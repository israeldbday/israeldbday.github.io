     <div class="content " > <br>
     <p>Online consumers are constantly seeking experiences, such as vacations, restaurant outings and exciting jobs in order to improve their well-being. However, e-commerce search engines only support searches for experiences to a very limited extent -- you can search on the objective attributes of a service (e.g., hotel price and location), but the experiential aspects are buried in online reviews. E-commerce sites make some effort to surface comments from reviews, but users can still not specify experiential aspects (e.g., romantic hotel in a quiet Mediterranean town) in their queries. There has been considerable work in the NLP community to recognize and extract subjective text, but that’s only the first step towards querying.
<br>

            To address this challenge, we introduce OpineDB, a subjective database. OpineDB is based on a data model that carefully balances the richness and bottom-up nature of natural language and the top-down design principles of databases. OpineDB is able to answer queries that combine multiple subjective conditions and aggregate subjective data. Unlike a traditional database system, there may not be a 1-1 mapping between query terms and the database schema. In some cases, OpineDB needs to find the closest attribute (or combination of attributes) that answers a user query, and in some cases it may have to fall back to retrieval directly from the review text.

    <p>Histograms are a well studied and  simple way to summarize data. As such, they are used extensively in a variety of applications that require estimates of data frequency values. Significant previous work has studied the problem of finding optimal histograms with respect to an error measure, as well as finding approximately optimal histograms. In this paper we study the classic problem of finding an optimal histogram for a dataset, with a new twist: We are given a number k and a bound  beta on the number of buckets. Our goal is to find k data items to remove from the dataset, such that the optimal histogram with beta buckets will have minimal error. </p>

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>Schema matching is a task at the heart of integrating
            heterogeneous structured and semi-structured data with
            applications in data warehousing, process matching, data analysis
            recommendations, Web table matching, etc. Schema matching is
            known to be an uncertain process and a common method of
            overcoming this uncertainty is by introducing a human expert
            with a ranked list of possible schema matches from which the
            expert may choose, known as top-K matching. In this work
            we propose a learning algorithm that utilizes an innovative set
            of features to rerank a list of schema matches and improves
            upon the ranking of the best match. The proposed algorithm
            assists the matching process by introducing a quality set of
            alternative matches to a human expert. It also serves as a step
            towards eliminating the involvement of human experts as decision
            makers in a matching process altogether. A large scale empirical
            evaluation with real-world benchmark shows the effectiveness of
            the proposed algorithmic solution.

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>We discuss the complexity of enumerating the answers of Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs), and focus on the ability to list output tuples with constant delay following linear-time preprocessing. A known dichotomy classifies the self-join-free CQs into those that admit such enumeration, and those that do not. We aspire to have a similar characterization for UCQs. It was claimed in the past that a UCQ is hard if one of its queries is hard. We examine the task of enumerating UCQs, and show that some unions containing a hard query are tractable. In fact, a UCQ may be tractable even if it does not contain a single tractable CQ.

    <div class="content"> <br>
    <p>Data analytics often involves hypothetical reasoning: repeatedly modifying the data and observing the induced effect on the computation result of a data-centric application. Previous work has shown that fine-grained data provenance can help make such an analysis more efficient: instead of a costly re-execution of the underlying application, hypothetical scenarios are applied to a pre-computed provenance expression. However, storing provenance for complex queries and large-scale data leads to a significant overhead, which is often a barrier to the incorporation of provenance-based solutions.    

To this end, we present a framework that allows to reduce provenance size. Our approach is based on reducing the provenance granularity using user defined abstraction trees over the provenance variables; the granularity is based on the anticipated hypothetical scenarios.  We formalize the tradeoff between 
provenance size and supported granularity of the hypothetical reasoning, and study the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, provide efficient algorithms for tractable cases and heuristics for others. We experimentally study the performance of our solution for various queries and abstraction trees. Our study shows that the algorithms generally lead to substantial speedup of hypothetical reasoning, with a reasonable loss of accuracy.

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is unanimously considered as a breakthrough technology, used in solving a growing number of AI challenges previously considered to be intractable.

            In our ongoing research we are developing ATENA, an autonomous system for data exploration and visualization. Given a new dataset, the goal of ATENA is to assist human analysts in analyzing and understanding it by automatically performing a complete sequence of analysis operations that highlight interesting aspects of the data. At any point, the user can regain control and perform a manual operation. Afterwards, ATENA readjusts its exploration path, and resumes the automatic exploration w.r.t. the user’s last action.
            
            Notably, ATENA learns how to perform analysis operations by independently interacting with the dataset, without any human assistance or supervision, using a novel DRL solution. First, we devise a DRL environment comprising a machine-readable encoding for analysis operations, result-sets and visualizations, and a novel “reward” system for such operations. Then, we design an efficient DRL neural network architecture, capable of effectively choosing between hundreds of thousands of distinct operations.

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>Election databases are the main elements of a recently introduced framework that aims to create bridges between the computational social choice and the data management communities. An election database consists of incomplete information about the preferences of voters, in the form of partial orders, alongside with standard database relations that provide contextual information. Earlier work in computational social choice focused on the computation of possible winners and necessary winners that are determined by the available incomplete information and the voting rule at hand. The presence of the relational context, however, permits the formulation of sophisticated queries about voting rules, candidates, potential winners, issues, and positions on issues. Such queries can be given possible answer semantics and necessary answer semantics on an election database, where the former means that the query is true on some completion of the given partial orders and the latter means that the query is true on every such completion. </p>

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>Many crowdsourcing applications maintain a repository of user profiles with semantically rich information on each user. Such repositories have a potential of allowing active opinion procurement: reaching out to users to ask for their opinions on different topics. An important desideratum of the procurement process is that it targets a diverse set of users, so that the procured opinions are representative. To realize this potential, we present PODIUM: a first framework, to our knowledge, that supports the selection of diverse crowd representatives in presence of high-dimensional, semantically rich user profiles. We demonstrate that data dimensionality is a challenge for both defining and achieving diversification. We address these challenges by proposing a simple, explainable and customizable diversity notion, and studying the computational problem of finding a diverse user subset. We show that the problem is intractable, and provide a greedy algorithm that computes an approximate solution. We have implemented our solution and tested it on real-world crowdsourcing platform data. Our experimental results show that PODIUM is effective in selecting users with diverse properties, and in turn that the opinions of these users are diverse according to multiple metrics.

     <p>The distribution of personal data such as emails, photos, and social interactions over platforms of commercial vendors such as social networks, is of great current concern. Aside from issues of privacy, by giving up the management of personal data the users do not realize the full potential of the data that they generate or that is collected about them. We develop a declarative, generic client-side framework that allows users to jointly access and manage data they store on different platforms and to share this data with others without compromising access control rights and data integrity. We support a fine-grained model of access control that allows to account for different real-life aspects of data ownership, including joint ownership on data items, multiple alternative access paths and conceptual ownership on contents. We then develop modes of interaction between peers to establish data sharing rights, accompanied by efficient algorithms for the derivation of data annotations and dynamic evaluation of access control policies.</p>

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>Many popular e-commerce platforms serve as an intermediary between companies/manufacturers and consumers, 
            receiving a commission per
            purchase. To increase sales, these platforms tend to support as many
            items as possible, however too large of a selection incurs
            substantial maintenance overhead, and has been shown to overwhelm
            shoppers. Therefore, selecting a reduced inventory, that still
            covers most consumer needs, is an important goal. Selecting an
            appropriate subset of items is also imperative when launching an
            express branch or gradually expanding to new regions. A naive, yet
            popular, solution is to focus on the top-k best selling items. This
            approach however entirely ignores the hidden relations between items
            and particularly the common will of shoppers to buy, in the absence
            of an item they are looking for, a reasonably satisfying
            alternative.
            In this paper we introduce the Preference Cover problem,
            which given a large set of items, a bound on the number of items
            that can be supported and consumer preferences in terms of items
            popularity and suitability as alternatives, aims to select a subset
            of items which maximizes the likelihood of a purchase. We first
            model the problem via a dedicated weighted directed graph which
            captures the relevant information, then study two problem variants,
            which differ in their interpretation of the probabilistic
            dependencies between consumer preferences. We prove both variants are
            NP-hard, and characterize their approximation hardness. Since the
            overall number of items and the bound on the reduced item set are
            very large - in the order of magnitude of millions - we propose a
            highly parallelizable and scalable algorithm along with approximation
            guarantees. Finally, we present an end-to-end solution that fits the
            real-world e-commerce data, and provide an extensive set of
            experiments  demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our
            solution.</p>

     <div class="content"> <br>
     <p>A tree decomposition of a graph facilitates computations by grouping vertices into bags that are interconnected in an acyclic structure; hence their importance in a plethora of problems such as query evaluation over databases and inference over probabilistic graphical models. The relative benefit from different tree decompositions is measured by diverse (sometime complex) cost functions that vary from one application to another. For generic cost functions like width and fill-in, an optimal tree decomposition can be efficiently computed in some cases, notably when the number of minimal separators is bounded by a polynomial (due to Bouchitte and Todinca); we refer to this assumption as “poly-MS.” To cover the variety of cost functions in need, it has recently been proposed to devise algorithms for enumerating many decomposition candidates for applications to choose from using specialized, or even machine-learned, cost functions.
            We explore the ability to produce a large collection of “high quality” tree decompositions. We present the first algorithm for ranked enumeration of the proper (non-redundant) tree decompositions, or equivalently minimal triangulations, under a wide class of cost functions that substantially generalizes the above generic ones. On the theoretical side, we establish the guarantee of polynomial delay if poly-MS is assumed, or if we are interested in tree decompositions of a width bounded by a constant. We describe an experimental evaluation on graphs of various domains (including join queries, Bayesian networks, tree-width benchmarks and random), and explore both the applicability of the poly-MS assumption and the performance of our algorithm relative to the state of the art.</p>
